#### 3.1.2 Web Search for Coaching Best Practices
- **Description**: The chatbot searches the web for recent best practices in coaching youth soccer (e.g., "What are the latest tips for coaching 8-year-olds?").
- **Requirements**:
  - Integrate a web search capability to fetch current articles, blogs, or studies (within the last 1-2 years).
  - Summarize findings in a concise, actionable format (e.g., "Recent articles suggest focusing on small-sided games to improve engagement for 8-year-olds.").

#### 3.1.3 Equipment Recommendations
- **Description**: The chatbot helps parents shop for equipment compliant with league rules by searching the web (e.g., "What cleats should I buy for my U8 player?").
